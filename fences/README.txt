This means there is no guarantee the track is properly fitted.
Please ensure the track is inside the DroneLab boundaries at all times to avoid collisions with the net!

This folder contains the different circuits with the name convention circuit_NAME.waypoints

The directory /missions contains mission files for the drone to automatically go around the respective circuit,
with the name convention mission_NAME, where NAME is the name of the circuit the mission goes through.

For example, 'circuit_default.waypoints' has its respective 'mission_default.waypoints' that, when loaded into the
drone, will perform a lap starting at the default starting point (1P).
